This experiment focuses on what happens to the values of neighbourhood when changing the shapes and number of ponds. All floorplans are random floorplans, created with the random algorithm.

Every configuration of water has a label. Below is a list of what each label means.

- setup1 - 1 pond of 80x72
- setup2 - 2 ponds of 64x45
- setup3 - 3 ponds of 48x40
- setup4 - 4 ponds of 40x36
